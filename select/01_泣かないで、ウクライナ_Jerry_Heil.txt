Mama, I'm no longer a kid
You remember from the pics pics
Pics pics pics
Mama, sing your lulla lullaby
Inner kiddo needs a fix fix
Fix fix fix
I took parts of my homeland with me
Rivers falling from my cheeks cheeks
Cheeks cheeks cheeks
Never thought that just one day
Can turn out to be the weeks weeks
Weeks weeks weeks

Everything starts from the light
But the light starts in the dark dark
Dark dark dark
If you need a fire to fight
Baby I can be your spark spark
Spark spark spark
